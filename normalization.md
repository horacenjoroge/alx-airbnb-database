# AirBnB Database Normalization Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the AirBnB database schema against normalization principles and ensures compliance with Third Normal Form (3NF).

## Current Schema Analysis

### First Normal Form (1NF) Compliance
**Status: âœ… COMPLIANT**

All tables satisfy 1NF requirements:
- Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values
- No repeating groups or arrays
- Each row is unique (enforced by primary keys)
- Column names are unique within each table

**Evidence:**
- User table: All fields contain single values (first_name, last_name, email)
- Property table: Each attribute represents a single piece of information
- All tables use proper data types without multi-valued fields

### Second Normal Form (2NF) Compliance
**Status: âœ… COMPLIANT**

All tables satisfy 2NF requirements:
- All tables are in 1NF
- No partial dependencies exist (all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key)

**Analysis by Table:**
- **User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message**: All use single-column primary keys (UUID), so partial dependencies cannot exist
- All non-key attributes depend entirely on their respective primary keys

### Third Normal Form (3NF) Analysis
**Status: âœ… MOSTLY COMPLIANT with minor optimization opportunity**

Most tables satisfy 3NF requirements with one potential improvement area:

#### Compliant Tables:
1. **User Table**: No transitive dependencies
   - All attributes directly depend on user_id
   - No attribute depends on another non-key attribute

2. **Booking Table**: No transitive dependencies
   - total_price depends directly on booking_id (calculated from dates and property price)
   - All other attributes directly relate to the booking

3. **Payment Table**: No transitive dependencies
   - All attributes directly describe the payment

4. **Review Table**: No transitive dependencies
   - All attributes directly relate to the specific review

5. **Message Table**: No transitive dependencies
   - All attributes directly describe the message

#### Potential Optimization:
**Property Table - Location Attribute**
- Current: `location` stored as VARCHAR
- **Minor 3NF Consideration**: If location includes city, state, country as a concatenated string, this could create transitive dependencies

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```sql
-- Optional: Create separate Location table for better normalization
CREATE TABLE Location (
    location_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    street_address VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    postal_code VARCHAR(20),
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
    longitude DECIMAL(11, 8)
);

-- Modify Property table
ALTER TABLE Property 
ADD COLUMN location_id UUID,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES Location(location_id);
```

## Normalization Steps Applied

### Step 1: Eliminate Repeating Groups (1NF)
- **Action Taken**: Schema designed with atomic values from the start
- **Result**: Each field contains single, indivisible values

### Step 2: Eliminate Partial Dependencies (2NF)
- **Action Taken**: Used UUID primary keys for all entities
- **Result**: No composite keys that could create partial dependencies

### Step 3: Eliminate Transitive Dependencies (3NF)
- **Action Taken**: Separated entities by their functional dependencies
- **Examples**:
  - User information separated from Property information
  - Booking details separated from Payment details
  - Review content separated from User/Property references

## Functional Dependencies

### User Table
```
user_id â†’ first_name, last_name, email, password_hash, phone_number, role, created_at
```

### Property Table
```
property_id â†’ host_id, name, description, location, price_per_night, created_at, updated_at
host_id â†’ (references User table)
```

### Booking Table
```
booking_id â†’ property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status, created_at
property_id â†’ (references Property table)
user_id â†’ (references User table)
```

### Payment Table
```
payment_id â†’ booking_id, amount, payment_date, payment_method
booking_id â†’ (references Booking table)
```

### Review Table
```
review_id â†’ property_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at
property_id â†’ (references Property table)
user_id â†’ (references User table)
```

### Message Table
```
message_id â†’ sender_id, recipient_id, message_body, sent_at
sender_id â†’ (references User table)
recipient_id â†’ (references User table)
```

## Redundancy Analysis

### Eliminated Redundancies:
1. **User Information**: Stored once in User table, referenced by foreign keys
2. **Property Information**: Stored once in Property table, referenced in Bookings/Reviews
3. **Booking Information**: Stored once in Booking table, referenced in Payment table

### Acceptable Redundancies:
1. **Timestamps**: Each table maintains its own timestamps for audit trails
2. **total_price in Booking**: Calculated field for performance (denormalization for read optimization)

## Performance Considerations

The current schema balances normalization with performance:
- **Normalized structure** reduces data redundancy
- **Strategic denormalization** (total_price in Booking) improves query performance
- **Proper indexing** maintains join performance across normalized tables

## Conclusion

The AirBnB database schema is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** with the following characteristics:

âœ… **Compliance Achieved:**
- No repeating groups (1NF)
- No partial dependencies (2NF) 
- No transitive dependencies (3NF)
- Proper entity separation
- Efficient foreign key relationships

ðŸ“Š **Optional Enhancement:**
- Location table separation for more granular geographic queries
- This is an optimization, not a normalization requirement

The schema effectively balances normalization principles with practical performance needs for an AirBnB-style application.
